1. Modify Programming Project 7 from Chapter 2 so that it includes the following function:

void pay_amount (int dollars, int *twenties, int *tens,
int *fives, int *ones);
The function determines the smallest number of $20, $10, $5, and $1 bills necessary to pay
the amount represented by the do1lars parameter. The twenties parameter points to a
variable in which the function will store the number of $20 bills required. The tens,.
fives, and ones parameters are similar.


1.
Suppose that the following declarations are in effect:

int a[] = {5, 15, 34, 54, 14, 2, 52, 72};
int *p = &a [1], *q = &a [5];

(a) What is the value of * (p+3)?
(b) What is the value of * (q-3)?
(c) What is the value of q - Ñ€?
(d) Is the condition p < q true or false?
(e) Is the condition *p < *q true or false?

(A) 14 (B) 34 (C) 4 (D) TRUE (E) FALSE

2. Suppose that high, low, and middle are all pointer variables of the same type, and that
low and high point to elements of an array. Why is the following statement illegal, and
how could it be fixed?

middle = (low + high) / 2;
